Donald Rumsfeld, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense, famously discussed the concept of "known knowns" during a press briefing in 2002. His full statement was:

> "There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know."

When Rumsfeld referred to **"known knowns,"** he was talking about information or facts that we are aware of and understand. These are things we know with certainty. For example, in a military context, a *known known* might be the capabilities of a particular weapon system or the location of an enemy force.

The broader context of his statement was about the challenges of intelligence and decision-making, particularly in the lead-up to the Iraq War. Rumsfeld was emphasizing the complexity of understanding and anticipating threats, acknowledging that while some information is clear and certain, much remains uncertain or completely unknown.

His statement has since been widely discussed and analyzed, often cited in discussions about **risk management, decision theory, and the limits of knowledge**.

> Donald Rumsfeld, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense, famously spoke about "known knowns" during a 2002 press briefing while discussing intelligence and uncertainty, particularly regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. His statement outlined a framework for understanding different levels of knowledge:
> 
> **Known knowns** – Things we know that we know. These are facts that are well understood and confirmed.
> 
> **Known unknowns** – Things we know that we don’t know. These are gaps in our knowledge that we are aware of.
> 
> **Unknown unknowns** – Things we don’t know that we don’t know. These are unforeseen, unpredictable factors that can surprise us.
> 
> His point was that the most dangerous uncertainties often come from the "unknown unknowns," the risks or threats we don’t even realize exist. While his phrasing was initially mocked, the concept itself is widely used in risk management, intelligence analysis, and decision-making.
