Donald Rumsfeld, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense, famously spoke about "known knowns" during a 2002 press briefing while discussing intelligence and uncertainty, particularly regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. His statement outlined a framework for understanding different levels of knowledge:

**Known knowns** – Things we know that we know. These are facts that are well understood and confirmed.

**Known unknowns** – Things we know that we don’t know. These are gaps in our knowledge that we are aware of.

**Unknown unknowns** – Things we don’t know that we don’t know. These are unforeseen, unpredictable factors that can surprise us.

His point was that the most dangerous uncertainties often come from the "unknown unknowns," the risks or threats we don’t even realize exist. While his phrasing was initially mocked, the concept itself is widely used in risk management, intelligence analysis, and decision-making.
