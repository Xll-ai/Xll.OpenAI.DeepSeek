## Summary Table

| **Period**  | **Rating** | **Key Drivers** |
|------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| 1980â€“1984  | **2â€“3** | Cold War tensions, Reaganâ€™s policies, nuclear brinkmanship. |

## Conclusion
- **Best relations (Peak):** Early 1990s (USSR collapse, cooperative efforts).  
- **Worst relations (Low point):** 2022â€“2025 (Ukraine War, sanctions, open hostility).  
- **Key factors driving deterioration:** NATO expansion, Russian territorial aggression, election interference, Western sanctions.  

A **"10" remains hypothetical**, as East-West relations have never reached a true "family-level" integration. However, post-1991 remains the closest attempt at real cooperation.
